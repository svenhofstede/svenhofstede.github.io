He mentions 2/3 of his ideas failed. Being lazy means you DO move on to the next idea and don&rsquo;t stick to it.</p><h5 id=humility>Humility</h5><p>Being at best competent as a statician and scientist. You know enough to talk to expert but you&rsquo;re not an expert but this allows you to learn.</p><h3 id=math-vs-computer-science>Math vs. Computer Science</h3><p>Need to be good at both. Best to atleast study one of these and otherwise study science. Just studying Science (biology, neuroscience, ..) will give you the tools like relentlessness.</p><p>Big Oh notation is important as it gives you the implications of runtimes of programs</p><p>Know your data structures</p><p>Computer science has algorithms and data structures, Data science has random variables and probably modeling</p><p>The difficulty is to find the context when none is provided. Give someone a challenge and mention that they should use a Hashmap. Chances are they won&rsquo;t have a problem implementing it. Give someone a challenge without any context (don&rsquo;t mention hashmap) and now you have a proper indication of a real-world response.</p><p>Statisticians typically don&rsquo;t have the computer science habits. Modular software, testing, code reviews, continuous integration, source control, ..</p><h3 id=kaggle-competitions>Kaggle competitions</h3><p>Kaggle skips a lot of steps. A lot of the work has been done for you. Implementing the machine learning part is typically one of the last steps.</p><h3 id=hadoop--data-science>Hadoop & data science</h3><p>If the traditional infrastructure isn&rsquo;t sufficient, a scientist will find a way to get it to run. It&rsquo;s part of the job.</p><h4 id=unit-of-analysis-problem>Unit of analysis problem</h4><p>Relational databases are bad at:</p><ul><li>COUNT DISTINCT - Star models are not optimized for this</li><li>Cursors - If you are using cursors, there is something wrong</li><li>ALTER TABLE_OF_DOOM - That one table in your data warehouse that you cannot touch</li></ul><p>Databases are optimized to analyse transactions. Financial reporting, enterprise resource planning, &mldr;</p><p>Asking questions where all the things you need to know are not in a single table row is typically unperformant in a database.</p><p>Hadoop is simply a file system. You can structure your data as you like. Pull all the fields you need into a single record.</p><h3 id=where-should-you-work-when-starting-out>Where should you work when starting out</h3><p>Start up - Wearing two hats, jack of all trades.</p><p>Close to the money - You can convince people how much money you save or make the company.</p><h3 id=education-and-growth>Education and growth</h3><p>Data scientists usually work in lonely teams, by themselves. No contact and no sharing of data because it&rsquo;s too valuable. No sharing of best practices. Need for communities.</p><h3 id=realtime-ml>Realtime ML</h3><p>Realtime ML is rarely necessary. Pattern in data doesn&rsquo;t change so fast.</p><p>Sometimes writing code to test &lsquo;how something will turn out&rsquo; takes longer than implementing an experiment on live users and seeing the result.</p><h3 id=valuable-stats-content-to-learn>Valuable stats content to learn</h3><ul><li>Linaer Regression</li><li>T Test</li><li>Binominal distributions</li><li>Confidence intervals</li></ul><h3 id=josh-wills>Josh Wills</h3><p>Funny and down to earth guy. And I like that he&rsquo;s wearing sandals :)</p></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
