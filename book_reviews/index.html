Written by Austin Kleon
I&rsquo;m very much an introvert. I have a difficulty &lsquo;marketing&rsquo; myself by showing my work.
This book gives a very concise introduction on the need for showing your work and also some concrete tips on how to do it. After reading it I 100% agree with the message.
Focus on documenting instead of creating perfect content. Document your process of learning and write out your thought process.

Written by Cathy O’Neil
Machine Learning and other mathematical algorithms are more and move taking over decision making. Whether someone is given a loan or an insurance policy. If someone gets fired because of not achieving the required efficiency based on the algorithm&rsquo;s requirements or if someone gets the job in the first place. If someone might continue to commit crimes if we keep them on the street. If someone is showered with expensive, for-profit college advertisements or other high-interest, predatory loans.

Written by Napoleon Hill
What would it be like to interview the devil? Well, turns out it&rsquo;s extremely educational.
In this book Napoleon Hill first gives a rundown of the early life of Napoleon Hill and the problems he encounters. The second part is an interview, or rather a confession, with the devil. The interview part is the core of the book and the reason you should read it. During the interview the devil is obliged to give full, detailed and uncensored explanation of how he is brainwashing people into becoming drifters.

Written by Steven Pressfield
This books deals with the Resistance creative thinkers feel. Being creative is hard and takes much effort. Being creative is producing something that didn&rsquo;t exist before. Most people stick to consuming instead of producing as consuming is the route of least resistance. Forcing yourself and embracing the uncomfort of producing/being creative will turn someone pro, as the author describes.
The author talks about the discipline someone needs to be succesfull in creative endeavours.

Written by Grant Cardone
I&rsquo;ll start out by saying that I&rsquo;m not a fan of this book. I was warned before reading that it isn&rsquo;t for everyone and I&rsquo;ll have to agree with that statement now. If not for the ease of reading, I don&rsquo;t think I would of completed it.
The book revolves around the idea of being completely consumed by your goals in life. This means ignoring criticism/negative feedback from anyone, putting in extra hours all the time, being ruthless towards your competitions and squeezing out every last drop of profit from your employees and clients.

Written by Paulo Coelho
This is one of those books that I&rsquo;ll remember for a long time. Paulo is a gifted story-teller.
The story is a journey. A journey of a young man to find his destiny. It&rsquo;s simple and well-written but what makes this book really great is that it&rsquo;s completely riddled with symbols and metaphors. Practically every character, location and situations that he encounters during his joruney can be related back to something in life.
