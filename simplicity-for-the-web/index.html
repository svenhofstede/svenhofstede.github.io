The need to write everything in Javascript which is in most cases a completely different language to your backend. The need to even make the distinction between a frontend and backend dev in the first place. Why has it gotten so far?!</p><p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of keeping the front-end of a web application simple. I&rsquo;d argue that most web applications is development today don&rsquo;t need to complex frontend app and would do just fine using server-side rendered templates. I&rsquo;ve recently used <a href=https://htmx.org/>htmx</a> together with FastAPI and the experience was great. I definitely had to learn a thing or two along the way but generally it was quite painless. Dynamically returning html snippets from the server just makes <strong>so much sense</strong> in my head. Super complex frontends like large social media websites and big e-commerce websites might be good candidates for an entirely separate Javascript frontends but it&rsquo;s major overkill for small crud applications and needlessly adds complexity.</p><p>I think this is also fed by the existence of code bootcamps who attempt to get a candidate ready for the industry asap. They are taught a Javascript framework to build frontends because there is a lot of open positions in this area. But I don&rsquo;t think these candidates are taught the downsides of this approach and of the existence of server-side rendered alternatives.</p><p>I&rsquo;m also a big fan of static site generators to serve content. It&rsquo;s lightning fast, costs practically nothing to host and is super safe as no one can comprise the backend.</p></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
