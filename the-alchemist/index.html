Paulo is a gifted story-teller.</p><p>The story is a journey. A journey of a young man to find his destiny. It&rsquo;s simple and well-written but what makes this book really great is that it&rsquo;s completely riddled with symbols and metaphors. Practically every character, location and situations that he encounters during his joruney can be related back to something in life. While reading I would constantly be realizing what the author actually means with what he&rsquo;s writing. I don&rsquo;t want to spoil anything so I&rsquo;m not going to give any examples. :)</p><p>I&rsquo;d say: <strong>Definitely read it</strong></p><p><img src=/img/book_reviews/the_alchemist.jpeg alt=cover></p></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
