A good programmer will know the right tool for the job by using existing Algorithms and Data Structures.</p><p>I think it&rsquo;s also a good idea to have the basic intuition of how well known algorithms work. For example, know how the various sorting algorithms are implemented. This will highlight good algorithn design.</p><p>I also plan to eventually finish the Algorithms course on Coursera starting <a href=https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-divide-conquer>here.</a></p><h3 id=design-patterns>Design Patterns</h3><p>This is very similar to the previous point. I need to learn to identify situation where I can use an existing Design Patterns.</p><p><a href=https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly/dp/0596007124>Head First Design Patterns</a> is on my reading list. I think this will give me a good base to start learning about Design Patterns on the job.</p><h3 id=test-driven-development>Test Driven Development</h3><p>The concepts of TDD make much sense to me and I believe that it&rsquo;s critical if you want to end up with maintainable code. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s makes development &rsquo;easier&rsquo; as you need to think about and write tests. It also forces you to deal with all edge cases in your code which is only a good thing.</p><p>Becoming comfortable with the TDD workflow will be my first priority.</p><h3 id=writing-clean-code>Writing clean code</h3><p>Beginner&rsquo;s code is not pretty. I&rsquo;m hoping to write some proper clean code as soon as possible. Not enough attention is spent on this subject in courses or schools.</p><h3 id=java--python>Java & Python</h3><p>I want to be proficient at both Java & Python. That way I have nice balance between dynamic and statically typed. These language also see two difference usages in the workplace and they both still have a bright future ahead of them.</p><p>In developing for the web I&rsquo;ll also pick up some Javascript.</p></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
