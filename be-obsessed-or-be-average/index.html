I was warned before reading that it isn&rsquo;t for everyone and I&rsquo;ll have to agree with that statement now. If not for the ease of reading, I don&rsquo;t think I would of completed it.</p><p>The book revolves around the idea of being completely consumed by your goals in life. This means ignoring criticism/negative feedback from anyone, putting in extra hours all the time, being ruthless towards your competitions and squeezing out every last drop of profit from your employees and clients.</p><p>Grant is coming from a sales background. The characteristics listed above could be more present in sales positions compared to say, IT positions. The environment is different, the &lsquo;win-situation&rsquo; is different, your compensation is different.</p><p>The book is a collection of short chapters each highlighting aspects of <em>being obsessed</em>. However this book also suffers from the typical filler-content that bugs these types of books. In fact, reading through I rarely stopped and thought &lsquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s something new and interesting&rsquo;. There was also a lot of self-promotion and promoting of his other products.</p><p>Obviously the system has been working for him. He&rsquo;s an extremely successful business man, real-estate investor and all-round sales guru. It&rsquo;s therefore hard for me to deny this mentality works. I agree that being committed and certain of your goal is important. You need this to persevere through hard times. But Grant seems to take this to the extreme and I feel like extremes are rarely good.</p><p>I&rsquo;d say: <strong>Skip it</strong></p><p><img src=/img/book_reviews/be_obsessed.jpeg alt=cover></p></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
