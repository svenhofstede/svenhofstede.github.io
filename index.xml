Obviously some of them will be very limited in scope and won&amp;rsquo;t be anything special. It&amp;rsquo;s all about getting a feel for how this stuff works instead of building production ready products. I also plan to document the progress for each of these projects by livestreaming on Youtube. Two additional goals that I&amp;rsquo;m setting is to use TDD and Functional programming in atleast one of the projects.</description></item><item><title>Book review: Weapon of Math Destruction</title><link>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/weapon-of-math-destruction/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/weapon-of-math-destruction/</guid><description>Written by Cathy O’Neil
Machine Learning and other mathematical algorithms are more and move taking over decision making. Whether someone is given a loan or an insurance policy. If someone gets fired because of not achieving the required efficiency based on the algorithm&amp;rsquo;s requirements or if someone gets the job in the first place. If someone might continue to commit crimes if we keep them on the street. If someone is showered with expensive, for-profit college advertisements or other high-interest, predatory loans.</description></item><item><title>What I’m struggling with as a self-learner</title><link>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/self-learn-struggles/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/self-learn-struggles/</guid><description>Pretty soon I will be starting a new job where I will be working as a Java developer. I have some professional experience writing Scala code (Spark) but this was in a different context. Moving data around is very different to application development. I&amp;rsquo;m therefore spending a couple hours each week brushing up on my programming skills and I thought it would be interesting to document the struggles I&amp;rsquo;m currently facing.</description></item><item><title>My News Diet</title><link>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/the-news-diet/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/the-news-diet/</guid><description>I actively try to avoid any type of news/media.

A good programmer will know the right tool for the job by using existing Algorithms and Data Structures.
I think it&amp;rsquo;s also a good idea to have the basic intuition of how well known algorithms work. For example, know how the various sorting algorithms are implemented. This will highlight good algorithn design.
I also plan to eventually finish the Algorithms course on Coursera starting here.</description></item><item><title>Book review: Outwitting the Devil</title><link>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/outwitting-the-devil/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/outwitting-the-devil/</guid><description>Written by Napoleon Hill
What would it be like to interview the devil? Well, turns out it&amp;rsquo;s extremely educational.
In this book Napoleon Hill first gives a rundown of the early life of Napoleon Hill and the problems he encounters. The second part is an interview, or rather a confession, with the devil. The interview part is the core of the book and the reason you should read it. During the interview the devil is obliged to give full, detailed and uncensored explanation of how he is brainwashing people into becoming drifters.</description></item><item><title>Book review: War of Art</title><link>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/war-of-art/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/war-of-art/</guid><description>Written by Steven Pressfield
This books deals with the Resistance creative thinkers feel. Being creative is hard and takes much effort. Being creative is producing something that didn&amp;rsquo;t exist before. Most people stick to consuming instead of producing as consuming is the route of least resistance. Forcing yourself and embracing the uncomfort of producing/being creative will turn someone pro, as the author describes.
The author talks about the discipline someone needs to be succesfull in creative endeavours.</description></item><item><title>Book review: Be Obsessed or Be Average</title><link>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/be-obsessed/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/be-obsessed/</guid><description>Written by Grant Cardone
I&amp;rsquo;ll start out by saying that I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of this book. I was warned before reading that it isn&amp;rsquo;t for everyone and I&amp;rsquo;ll have to agree with that statement now. If not for the ease of reading, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I would of completed it.
The book revolves around the idea of being completely consumed by your goals in life. This means ignoring criticism/negative feedback from anyone, putting in extra hours all the time, being ruthless towards your competitions and squeezing out every last drop of profit from your employees and clients.</description></item><item><title>What Clean Code taught me</title><link>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/clean-code-summary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/clean-code-summary/</guid><description>This blog post is work-in-progress while working myself through the book. It will loosely follow the structure of the book.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on reading through Clean Code by Robert C. Martin. It was clear from the start that the book is full of incredible content and it&amp;rsquo;s well worth the time to study it properly. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to capture the key take-aways I have come across. There is much more to the book then what I&amp;rsquo;m highlighting here but these are things that were somewhat new to me and stuck in my mind as being worth remembering.</description></item><item><title>My Reading List</title><link>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/book-list/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/book-list/</guid><description>My ever-evolving reading list for the coming weeks, months, years :)

This is one of those books that I&amp;rsquo;ll remember for a long time. Paulo is a gifted story-teller.
The story is a journey. A journey of a young man to find his destiny. It&amp;rsquo;s simple and well-written but what makes this book really great is that it&amp;rsquo;s completely riddled with symbols and metaphors. Practically every character, location and situations that he encounters during his joruney can be related back to something in life.</description></item><item><title>Homer's face.. with a Random Forest!</title><link>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/homers-face-random-forest/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/homers-face-random-forest/</guid><description>Classifying Simpsons characters in images Dataset: Many thanks to jbencina for making this dataset available. The dataset is available on github here:
Collection of 30,693 frames from 65 Simspsons episodes from seasons 3, 4, and 5. Each image is 160x120 pixels.
One collection (faces-clean-color) contains isolated frames of Homer (n=1,041), Marge (n=444), Lisa (n=358), and Bart (n=645) totalling (n=2,488). These files are labled as {instance_number}_{character_name}.jpg.

The radar chart is sometimes also referred to as a Spider chart.

Showcase what you can do The main reason I&amp;rsquo;m starting to blog is because I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to show what you&amp;rsquo;re good at. You can really showcase your expertise by writing in-depth articles on your subject matter. It&amp;rsquo;s freely available 24/7 for anyone interested and it gets your name or brand out there.</description></item><item><title>Predicting titanic survivors</title><link>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/predicting-titanic-survivors/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/predicting-titanic-survivors/</guid><description>Predicting Titanic Survivors.. again Yes.. I also decided to give the Titanic survival prediction a go. It&amp;rsquo;s probably the go-to starting point for people wanting to learn Machine Learning. Apart from some missing values the dataset itself is pretty clean, the label we are trying to predict &amp;lsquo;makes sense&amp;rsquo;. You can easily reason about what we are going for.

Simply put: How fast will my function run if I change the input from 10 elements to 1000000 elements. Big-O is all about the approximate worst-case performance of doing something. The upper bound is the mathematic limit of the worst output.
log of 50 = x
10^x = 50
To the power of what do I need to raise 10 to end up with 50.</description></item><item><title>Josh Wills - The Life of a Data Scientist</title><link>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/tech-talk-josh-wills/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/tech-talk-josh-wills/</guid><description>Traits of Data scientist Being relentless in a lazy way Most of your model assumptions are incorrect.

Unfortunately my gym opens at 8AM and in the evenings it&amp;rsquo;s very busy. Like queue-up-for-every-rack/bench busy. Being able to workout whenever I want to seemed pretty convenient so I sat down, did some calculations and came to the conclusion that the costs of buying everything for my home gym won&amp;rsquo;t be so bad.</description></item><item><title>Airbnb in New York</title><link>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/airbnb/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://svenhofstede.com/writings/airbnb/</guid><description>I find Airbnb itself to be an interesting concept.
