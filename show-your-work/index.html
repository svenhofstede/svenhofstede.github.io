I have a difficulty &lsquo;marketing&rsquo; myself by showing my work.</p><p>This book gives a very concise introduction on the need for showing your work and also some concrete tips on how to do it. After reading it I 100% agree with the message.</p><p>Focus on documenting instead of creating perfect content. Document your process of learning and write out your thought process. It stresses the need for a personal webspace that is owned solely by you. Embrace being an amateur and find that curiosity back.</p><p>I finished this book in one evening which is extremely quick. The book reads super fast and is also very short in terms of actual text. The books contains a lot of graphics and full page images. I don&rsquo;t think this book is worth the sticker price and the entire book could have been an extended blog post.</p><p>I&rsquo;d say: <strong>Read it</strong></p><p><img src=/img/book_reviews/show_your_work.jpeg alt=cover></p></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
