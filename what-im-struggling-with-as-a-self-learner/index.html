I have some professional experience writing Scala code (Spark) but this was in a different context. Moving data around is very different to application development. I&rsquo;m therefore spending a couple hours each week brushing up on my programming skills and I thought it would be interesting to document the struggles I&rsquo;m currently facing.</p><h3 id=recognizing-when-to-use-a-design-pattern>Recognizing when to use a design pattern</h3><p>I&rsquo;m still struggling to recognize when to implement design patterns. Main reason is probably because I don&rsquo;t know what they do yet :) I need to find some good resources that give a good overview of the patterns and when/how to implement them. Head First Design Patterns is on my reading list but will first need to purchase. There probably are some good resources online so I&rsquo;ll start my search there.</p><h3 id=finding-fun-projects-to-work-on>Finding fun projects to work on</h3><p>After learning the basics using online courses it&rsquo;s best to find a cool projects that you can work on. This works even better if you&rsquo;re developing something that you actually need. I however can&rsquo;t come up with any interesting projects that I personally have a use for.</p><p>I have &lsquo;resorted&rsquo; to create a simple game using the PyGame library. It&rsquo;s more of simulation game simulating a taxi company. This combines many aspects of programming that I would like to learn. Mostly TDD and object-oriented programming</p><h3 id=doing-the-work>Doing the work</h3><p>As with all learning activities that requires deliberate effort, it&rsquo;s hard to get started! After coming home from work it&rsquo;s tough to get yourself started.</p></article></main><footer id=footer></footer></body></html>
