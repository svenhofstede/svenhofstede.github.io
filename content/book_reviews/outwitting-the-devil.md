*Written by Napoleon Hill*

What would it be like to interview the devil? Well, turns out it's extremely educational. 

In this book Napoleon Hill first gives a rundown of the early life of Napoleon Hill and the problems he encounters. The second part is an interview, or rather a confession, with the devil. The interview part is the core of the book and the reason you should read it. During the interview the devil is obliged to give full, detailed and uncensored explanation of how he is brainwashing people into becoming drifters.

Drifters are people who move through life without purpose. They procrastinate. They are easily influenced. They prefer to *consume* instead of *create*. They are peons that the devil uses to spread the disease of drifting to other people by promoting mediocrity. Laziness + Indifference = Drifting. Fortunately the devil also explains in great detail how to prevent drifting.

**Definiteness of purposes** applied over **time**, thereby calling forth **hypnotic rhythm** in your favor, prevents drifting.

Of course the use of the devil character and interview format is, however brilliant, just another way of explaining the typical best-practices you will find in many books of this category. The interview format does make it a great read and nicely condenses the information in a neatly packed question-answer format. It coming from the devil itself gives it some additional credibility :) 

I would also recommend listening to the audiobook version. The two characters, Napoleon Hill and the devil are two different voice actors which really bring the interview to life. 

I'd say: **Definitely read it**
