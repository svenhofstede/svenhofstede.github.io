*Written by Steven Pressfield*

This books deals with the Resistance creative thinkers feel. Being creative is hard and takes much effort. Being creative is producing something that didn't exist before. Most people stick to consuming instead of producing as consuming is the route of least resistance. Forcing yourself and embracing the uncomfort of producing/being creative will turn someone *pro*, as the author describes.

The author talks about the discipline someone needs to be succesfull in creative endeavours. It may take many failed attempts to get to something worthwhile. The *pro* knows this and marches on.

The author also talks about changing your frame of mind from being myself to being **Myself Inc.** . Thinking of yourself as a brand or a company abstracts away feelings of self-doubt. You are working for Myself Inc. and trying to make this company great and successfull.

The *pro* is near machine-like in his quest to deliver. It's about just showing up and doing it, every day. None of your initial work will be good but as long as you keep trying, the forces of nature will at some point recognize your defeat of Resistance and help you become a master at your skill. 

While reading I drew parallels with the previous book I read *Outwitting the devils* where the devil himself is the force pulling us away from creative thinking. When the devil succeeds these people are moved to the 'drifters' category where people go on through their lives as mainly consumers instead of producers.

I'd say: **Read it**
