*Written by Grant Cardone*

I'll start out by saying that I'm not a fan of this book. I was warned before reading that it isn't for everyone and I'll have to agree with that statement now. If not for the ease of reading, I don't think I would of completed it. 

The book revolves around the idea of being completely consumed by your goals in life. This means ignoring criticism/negative feedback from anyone, putting in extra hours all the time, being ruthless towards your competitions and squeezing out every last drop of profit from your employees and clients. 

Grant is coming from a sales background. The characteristics listed above could be more present in sales positions compared to say, IT positions. The environment is different, the 'win-situation' is different, your compensation is different.

The book is a collection of short chapters each highlighting aspects of *being obsessed*. However this book also suffers from the typical filler-content that bugs these types of books. In fact, reading through I rarely stopped and thought 'Hey, that's something new and interesting'. There was also a lot of self-promotion and promoting of his other products. 

Obviously the system has been working for him. He's an extremely successful business man, real-estate investor and all-round sales guru. It's therefore hard for me to deny this mentality works. I agree that being committed and certain of your goal is important. You need this to persevere through hard times. But Grant seems to take this to the extreme and I feel like extremes are rarely good. 

I'd say: **Skip it**
