These are my intended side-project goals for this year. Obviously some of them will be very limited in scope and won't be anything special. It's all about getting a feel for how this stuff works instead of building production ready products. I also plan to document the progress for each of these projects by livestreaming on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/svenhofstede). Two additional goals that I'm setting is to use TDD and Functional programming in atleast one of the projects.


## Machine learning

**Classify Simpsons images** [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMZVZxCK-Y8g8BrwRLJMSTwV7EuSXW8s6)

* Complete the [Udacity Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) course. 
* Make a small python GUI program to manual classify lots of training data
* Use Tensorflow to classify characters of Simpsons characters in images
* Achieve a better accuracy then the [RandomForest model]({% post_url 2016-11-19-homers-face-random-forest %})
