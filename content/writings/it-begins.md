I’m totally expecting no one to ever read this. That’s totally fine because I’m only doing it to keep track of the journey. The journey of learning data science. The goal is the dedicate some time every other day to further my knowledge of data science. Hopefully, over time, I will be able to find a job so I can do it full time :) 

I will use this blog to do the following:

* Keep track of progress by listing accomplishments 
* Create blog posts of interesting material I come across along the way
* Review books/courses
* Hold myself accountable for putting in the time

Here we go :)
