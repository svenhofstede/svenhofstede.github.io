*Written by Austin Kleon*

I'm very much an introvert. I have a difficulty 'marketing' myself by showing my work. 

This book gives a very concise introduction on the need for showing your work and also some concrete tips on how to do it. After reading it I 100% agree with the message.

Focus on documenting instead of creating perfect content. Document your process of learning and write out your thought process. It stresses the need for a personal webspace that is owned solely by you. Embrace being an amateur and find that curiosity back.   

I finished this book in one evening which is extremely quick. The book reads super fast and is also very short in terms of actual text. The books contains a lot of graphics and full page images. I don't think this book is worth the sticker price and the entire book could have been an extended blog post. 

I'd say: **Read it**
