*Written by Paulo Coelho*

This is one of those books that I'll remember for a long time. Paulo is a gifted story-teller.

The story is a journey. A journey of a young man to find his destiny. It's simple and well-written but what makes this book really great is that it's completely riddled with symbols and metaphors. Practically every character, location and situations that he encounters during his joruney can be related back to something in life. While reading I would constantly be realizing what the author actually means with what he's writing. I don't want to spoil anything so I'm not going to give any examples. :)

I'd say: **Definitely read it**
